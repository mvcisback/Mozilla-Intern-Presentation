* DxR
** What is DxR
   - Dinos vs Robots Joke
   - What it actually means
     - Dehydra cross reference


** Future of DxR
   - Elastic Search <- Erik
   - [ ] New Plugin Infrastructure <- Erik
   - [ ] Javascript support <- ME
   - Rust?? <- nrc?
   - [ ] TYPE SEARCH!! <- ME

** Porting C Plugin
   - Really helped work on kinks in API
   - Horror stories of clang plugin

* Type Search
** Hoogle - What is is
   - Using Types as a query type
   - Structural Edits for fuzzy matching

** Specializing for C
   - Various attempts at query language
   - C++ 11 auto function definition looks like uncurried version
   - C++ 11 auto can act as wild card type

* SpiderFlunky
** Why not use framework _
   - Couldn't find a usuable one in Python
   - Specifically targeting Mozilla JS (not the same as EcmaScript)
   - Alot of tools are rotted

** Parsing the Parser API
   - Take the Mozilla Parser Api Wiki and parse it to create Node classes
   - If nothing else found a few bug/semicolons

** SpiderFlunky - Super Secret Haskell Port
   - Symmetric Parsing of Mozilla Parser API
   - Template Haskell _might_ be the way to emulate the dynamic Parsing using in SpiderFlunky
